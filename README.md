## :memo: About 

**This game is a hybrid of the classic games: Asteroids and Space Invaders.  
It was made using the JavaFX library inside NetBeans IDE.**

## :hammer: Usage

**JDK versions higher than 1.8 needs JavaFX to be imported as a separate set of libraries and modules.**

## :computer: Follow
